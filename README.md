# ChessGame_Capstone

Chess is a turn-based strategy board game that involves a lot tactical planning and board analysis to defeat your opponent. Your goal is to put the opponent into checkmate where the king cannot be defended and will be captured. The game is considered a stalemate if both players cannot make further moves to checkmate the opponent.  

There are 6 pieces that each player has: pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen, and king. Each type of piece has a unique way to move and capture enemy pieces.  

- Pawn: Can move one or two spaces forward on the first move and one space forward after that. It cannot move to a space that has a piece on it and captures enemy pieces diagonally in front.  
- Rook: Can move forwards, backwards, and sideways any number of spaces, captures enemy pieces along this path, and is blocked by friendly pieces.  
- Knight: Moves in a L shape (two spaces in a straight direction then a one space turn) and can move through friendly and enemy pieces. It must land on an empty square or an enemy piece.  
- Bishop: Moves diagonally any number of spaces, captures enemy pieces along this path, and is blocked by friendly pieces.  
- Queen: Moves like a bishop and rook combined. It is considered the most powerful piece.  
- King: Moves one space at a time to any of the 8 surrounding spaces. It cannot move into positions that would cause it to be attacked (check).  
- In addition to the basic movements, there are three special moves: en passant, pawn promotion, and castling.  
- En Passant: When an enemy player moves a pawn move to move two spaces forward and lands directly next to your pawn, you can move directly behind the enemy pawn and capture it.  
- Pawn Promotion: When a pawn moves all the way to the other side, it is promoted to another piece except for a pawn and king. Most of the time, a player will choose a queen since it is the most powerful piece  
- Castling: If the king has not moved, either rook has not move, and the spaces between them are empty, then the king can move two squares to the direction of the rook and the rook will move to the other side of it. Each square that the king moves through or lands on cannot put the king under attack (check).
